Hiya! I'm Thomas Smart. I am passionate about Information Technology. I find most areas of technology exciting, and love to learn about it!

My main areas of focus however are:

* Server and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure
	* Microsoft Storage Spaces Direct
	* HPE SAN and Proliant Servers
	* Hyper-V
	* VMWare ESXi and vSphere
* VoIP and Unified Communications
	* SIP
	* On-Premise Phone System Solutions
	* Hosted Phone System Solutions
	* Skype for Business
* Data Protection
	* Veeam Backup and Replication
	* Veeam Office 365 Backup
	* Veeam Cloud Connect
* Powershell

My aim for this site is to provide factual, public domain, information and guides for technology that I am passionate about.

I strive to not have an opinion within these blogs (Some of the older articles may present with one), however where present, it is purely my own opinion, and not that of anybody or organisation that I am associated with.
