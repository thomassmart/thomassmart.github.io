Hiya! I'm Tom Smart. I am passionate about making real world improvements using technology. Technology is a part of a solution, not the entire solution! I get great satisfaction when I see problems solved, and users happy with new solutions!

My main areas of focus are:

* Powershell
* Modern Workplace Solutions
	* Intune
	* SharePoint Online
	* OneDrive
	* AzureAD
	* M365 Compliance and Security
	* Teams
* Server and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure
	* Microsoft Storage Spaces Direct
	* HPE SAN and Proliant Servers
	* Hyper-V
	* VMWare ESXi and vSphere
* VoIP and Unified Communications
	* Teams Cloud Phone System
	* Meeting Room Solutions
	* SIP
	* On-Premise Phone System Solutions
	* Hosted Phone System Solutions
* Data Protection
	* Veeam Backup and Replication
	* Veeam Office 365 Backup
	* AFI.AI
	* Veeam Cloud Connect


My aim for this site is to provide factual, public domain, information and guides for technology that I am passionate about.

I strive to not have an opinion within these blogs (Some of the older articles may present with one), however where present, it is purely my own opinion, and not that of anybody or organisation that I am associated with.
