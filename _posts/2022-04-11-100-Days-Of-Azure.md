# Introduction
It's been trending a little bit lately,  #100DaysOf\<InsertCauseHere>. I have been wondering why this a hundred days of XYZ has been trending? Is it people trying to flex their intellect and deep knowledge on a subject? Perhaps its others raising awareness of how complex a technology could be, "How can they talk about this for 100 days?"

Whatever each person's motivation may be, I wanted to be transparent about mine. This is not to create a fanfare, but to provide context. Context can, and often is the most important consideration when reading or learning.

## Why?
It's not just one \[reason]!™️

I'm doing this to challenge myself. I'll be writing, learning, demonstrating perhaps even training throughout the next 100 days. Doing this publicly keeps me accountable. It allows me to share things I've learned, either from experience, or from interest. Hopefully you, and any other readers, find this engaging or interesting too!

There are so many technologies within Azure, too many to be an expert across. Many see Azure as a place to do 'Cloud' things. A place to store files, run VM's, or even use some 'modern' technology. Did you know you could build an IoT digital twin, how about make your own AI visual recognition models? Sure it can run VMs, teeny tiny burstable compute that is extremely cheap, and it can scale to gigantic VMs inconceivably large to those who have delved into server hardware. Mark Russinovich (Azure CTO, creator of Sysinternals and all round cool guy) has demonstrated the sheer size of these AzureBeast VMs through the ridiculous [TaskManagerBitmap](https://github.com/markrussinovich/TaskManagerBitmap)

[Alexey Polkovnikov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeypolkovnikov/) has created a great web app to visualize all the service offerings Azure has. And boy are there a few! You can explore by category, see what Regions have the availability and see how the offerings are intertwined. [Azure charts](https://azurecharts.com/overview), in a word, is fantastic.

If you're in the Azure Space, 💯% chance you'll be better off after visiting the page.

## How?
These blog posts. Sometimes spammed on Twitter or LinkedIn. (What can I say, I like feedback and interaction)

Some posts will be small. Tid bits of information that I know, or investigations into something that I didn't find interesting at first

Some posts will be large, spanning multiple days, covering complex constructs, or things that I can't shut up about.

I encourage you to spark conversation. If you find something interesting, let me know. I'll probably talk more about it. Find something poorly written, or not interesting, or wrong? Again, let me know. I've read my fair share of terrible blog posts, I'd like to not contribute in a negative way.

## When?
Monday through Friday I'll be posting. I'll review comments daily during the challenge, answer some in the comments section, others may become posts in their own right. Sometimes these will be published with artifacts in GitHub.

Saturday, we all need rest. I'll be taking time with the fam, enjoying the slow lane and hopefully disconnecting from technology and living in the analog.

Sunday, when weekend time permits, I'll be writing a sunday session. These will be a free form thing. Likened to peering into someone's notepad, they might get messy.

>Well. This is it. Day 1 of 💯. 

<sup>99 (minus weekends) to go 💪</sup>
