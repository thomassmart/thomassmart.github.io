<h1>S4B Room System on Surface Pro 3</h1>

<p class="view">by fatguymemoirs</p>

<p>Recently MS have released the Skype for Business Room system app on the windows store. Seeing that it has been made to work on a surface pro in a dock, I dusted off an old SP3 found a dock and though, lets give this a crack. After much dicking around and installing windows 10 I installed the app from the store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/skype-room-system/9nblggh5799l">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/skype-room-system/9nblggh5799l</a>)</p>

<p>The app shows 4 steps to config, I put in all the required details (After setting up a new Room System account in AD/Exch/S4B) and everything was going smoothly until I got to the last page. Please connect to a dock. WHAT?! The tablet is in the dock, whats the problem. The dock was working fine, with all peripherals attached through it.</p>

<p>Lesson here, vendors can mislead through not enough information. After much researching the app will only work with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Surface Pro 4 i5 (SP4's with other processors aren't supported)</li>
	<li>A 'Skype for Business' dock, i.e:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.crestron.com/products/line/crestron-rl-presentation-collaboration-conference-room-lync">Crestron RL2</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/smartdock">Logitech Smart Dock</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.polycom.com/hd-video-conferencing/microsoft-video/msr-series.html">Polycom MSR</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Its worth noting that most distributors and vendors provide these as a package</p>

<p>Its such a shame that MS have locked down the apps functionality, if you agree, please vote here: <a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/18416881-open-up-s4b-room-system-app-to-more-devices-and-do">Skype for Business Feedback</a></p>
