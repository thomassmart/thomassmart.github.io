<h1>Engaged tone when calling extension</h1>

<p class="view">by Thomas Smart</p>

<p>A client was experiencing a weird issue where an extension could call outbound, but didn’t receive any incoming calls. Callers would hear the busy tone, and if exchange um hadn’t been configured, disconnected.</p>

<p>Comparing the CS-User to a known working extension showed no differences and there were no extension conflicts.</p>

<p>If you are having this issue, I’d recommend the following</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the report server</li>
  <li>Click the user activity report</li>
  <li>Search for the user you completed the testing from <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/engaged-tone/sipdomain.png" alt="Screenshot" /></li>
  <li>Find the call  <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/engaged-tone/activity.png" alt="Screenshot" /></li>
  <li>Open the details of the call, then open the details for the diagnostics of the call</li>
</ol>

<p>In my instance, I had the error message</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-vbnet" data-lang="vbnet">The routing rules did not result in a final response and callee is not enabled for Unified Messaging</code></pre></figure>

<p><a href="https://greiginsydney.com/polycom-vvx-gives-sip480-cant-be-called/">Greig from greiginsydney has seen this before and reports that it is caused by bad firmware adding an incorrect call forward rule.</a> Following Greig’s steps and re-creating the AD account and Lync account resolved the issue. 
Also, <a href="https://greiginsydney.com">Greigs blog</a> is beyond wizardy and you should definately check it out.</p>
